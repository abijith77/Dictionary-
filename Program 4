4. Create two dictionaries one containing grocery items and their prices and another containing grocery items and quantity purchased. By using the values from these two dictionaries compute the total bill.

Program:
# Dictionary containing grocery items and their prices
grocery_prices = {
    "apple": 25.50,
    "banana": 7.0,
    "egg": 5.50,
    "bread": 35.00
}
#Dictionary with grocery items and quantity
grocery_quantity = {
    "apple": 3,
    "banana": 3,
    "egg": 5,
    "bread": 1
}

total_bill = 0
for item, quantity in grocery_quantity.items():
    if item in grocery_prices:
        total_bill += grocery_prices[item] * quantity
print("Total bill:", total_bill)

Output:
Total bill: 160.0
