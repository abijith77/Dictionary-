2. ) Create a dictionary containing names of students and marks.
obtained by them in three subjects. Write a program to replace the
marks in three subjects with the total in three subjects, and average marks. Also report the topper of the class.

Program:
student_marks = {
    "Singh": [80, 75, 90],
    "Saran": [85, 90, 95],
    "Billa": [95, 84, 90]
}

for student, marks in student_marks.items():
    total_marks = sum(marks)
    average_marks = int(total_marks / len(marks))
    student_marks[student] = [total_marks, average_marks]

topper = max(student_marks, key=lambda x: student_marks[x][1])

print("The total and average marks are:")
print("Updated student marks:")
for student, marks in student_marks.items():
    print(f"{student}: Total Marks - {marks[0]}, Average Marks - {marks[1]}")

print(f"\nTopper of the class: {topper}")

Output:
The total and average marks are:
Updated student marks:
Singh: Total Marks - 245, Average Marks - 81
Saran: Total Marks - 270, Average Marks - 90
Billa: Total Marks - 269, Average Marks - 89

Topper of the class: Saran
